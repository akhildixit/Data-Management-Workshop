							<h4><b>A Brief Introduction to Ontology-Mediated Query Answering </b><br><i>October 2, 1:30 pm - 2:45 pm</i></h4>
						<p><b>Abstract. </b>Recent years have seen an increasing interest in ontology-mediated query answering (OMQA),
								in which the semantic knowledge provided by an ontology is exploited when querying data.
								Enriching data with an ontology has several advantages (e.g., simplifying query formulation,
								integrating data from different sources, providing more complete answers to queries), but it
								also renders the query answering task more computationally involved, requiring the development
								of new algorithmic techniques. The aim of this talk will be to provide a gentle introduction to
								ontologies and OMQA, mentioning along the way some recent results and research directions.</p>

								<h4><b>Low-Resource Entity Resolution with Human-in-the-Loop </b><br><i>October 2, 3:15 pm - 3:50 pm</i></h4>
							<p><b>Abstract. </b>Entity Resolution (ER) is the task of identifying different representations of the same real-world entities across databases. It is a key step for knowledge-base creation and text mining.  While both non-learning and learning based approaches for ER have been developed, the latter type of approaches provide more automation and have flourished recently. Learning-based entity resolution usually involves a pipeline of labor-intensive steps including data preprocessing, training data creation, feature engineering, and model learning. In reality, most ER tasks do not have labeled data or only have a small amount of labeled data is available. In this talk, we will describe how we use human-in-the-loop machine learning, transfer learning, and deep learning to address the challenges in low-resource ER scenarios.</p>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/kun-small.jpg" alt="" /></span><b>Speaker Bio. </b> Kun Qian is a researcher at IBM Research - Almaden, working on human-in-the-loop machine learning for entity understanding. He is particularly interested in building intelligent human-in-the-loop systems, with intuitive user interface, for entity understanding and knowledge creation. His work on entity resolution and related topics has been published in CIKM, COLING, AAAI, and ACL. He also developed two active learning based systems for entity name normalization and entity resolution that have been included in the demo tracks of ICDE 2018 and VLDB 2019. Kun Qian obtained his PhD from UCSC in 2017.</p>

									<h4><b>Consistent Query Answering via SAT Solving </b><br><i>October 2, 3:55 pm - 4:30 pm</i></h4>
								<p><b>Abstract. </b>Consistent Query Answering (CQA) is a principled approach to handle inconsistent databases. It provides a strong semantic guarantee in the sense that the consistent answers remain the same no matter how the data is repaired. It is known that, for the SPJ queries on databases having primary key	constraints, computing consistent answers can be intractable, hence unlikely to be efficiently solvable. Existing approaches to CQA have limitations in terms of the size of the database. Recent advancements in satisfiability (SAT) solving, however, suggest that using SAT solvers is a promising approach towards building a scalable and comprehensive CQA system that may have an industrial impact. In this talk, we describe the consistent query answering problem, highlight our approach to solve it using SAT solvers, and outline the envisioned comprehensive CQA system. We will then describe how our approach can be extended to broader classes of queries and to other integrity constraints.</p>

In 2018, he obtained his MS degree with a project titled as &quot;Towards Consistent Query Answering via Modern SAT Solvers&quot;. His research is now funded by CROSS, and he continues to	extend his Master&#39;s work in his PhD to build a scalable and comprehensive system for consistent query answering, keeping the industry use-case in mind.</p>
